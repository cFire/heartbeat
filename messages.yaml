    title: RAID Array issues
    body: >
      We are having issues with our main storage array on the server. The filesystem
      is currently read-only and a great number of files are unable to be read properly.
      Naturally we are extremely concerned about this turn of events and are doing all
      we can to diagnose and resolve the issue.

      Update: There is indeed a very serious issue with the storage array.
      Many files are missing or partially zeroed out. We are most likely looking at
      restoring from last nights backups.

      Update: The server has been been re-provisioned running on new drives for the storage
      array and a backup from the night preceding the incident has been restored.

    title: 'Main server replacement'
    body: >
      At the start of the month our main server suffered some damage after a
      power outage and we have been running on spare hardware ever since.
      This Monday (July 26th) we are planning to replace it with the new
      permanent hardware setup. Expect half an hour or so of downtime while
      we make the switchover.

    title: 'Main server down'
    body: >
      After a brief power outage earlier today our main server is unfortunately
      failing to boot. We are investigating the issue and preparing spare
      hardware in case the main server cannot be repaired in a timely manner.

      Update; We have identified the power backplane has failed in the server
      and are working to commission replacement hardware.

      Update; We are now running on spare hardware and will be doing so for at
      least the next few days.

    title: 'Switching VPN up-link'
    body: >
      We will be switching over to a new VPN tunnel, this means the uplink
      will be down for a few minutes. The IP address will be moved to the
      new VPN tunnel so updating DNS records is not needed.

      Update; There was a misconfigured port forward for a few hours which
      prevented people from connecting to our main server over SSH. A fix
      has been pushed to the offending router.

    title: 'ISP outage'
    body: >
      Currently we cannot connect to our ISP. This appears to be an issue on
      the ISP side so unfortunately there is not much we can do right now
      beyond waiting for them to fix it. Updates will be posted here if more
      information becomes available.

      Update; Connectivity restored. Hopefully permanently.

      Update; It appears to have failed again. Updates will be posted here.

      Update; Uplink has returned. Keeping fingers thoroughly crossed.

      Update; Aaaaaaand it's gone. I think it's safe to say our uplink is
      currently being somewhat unreliable.

      will update on the issue as soon as further information becomes available.

      During the early hours of December 8th we suffered a lightning strike

      faulty equipment with a permanent new machine. Everything should be back
      to normal.

    title: 'Server down'
    body: >
      Never have I beheld such a relentless clusterfuck. While replacing the
      server for a hardware upgrade, the new machine decided to pretty well
      kill itself. It fried (at least) one major chip on the motherboard, the
      RAID controller that was in there, and every drive in the array. As it
      happens the raid controller and the drives where transplanted from the
      old machine. I think you see where this is going. Long story short: It
      will likely be a few days before I have found replacement drives,
      reinstalled the OS, and restored user data backups.

    title: 'Main server degraded performance'
    body: >
      Following last weeks hardware failure we are currently still running in
      degraded performance mode with only half the CPU cores available. Since
      we need to source some new hardware to permanently fix this, it will
      likely take a few weeks before we are back to full capacity.
