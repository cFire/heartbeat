  title: 'Main server degraded performance'
  body: Following last weeks hardware failure we are currently still running in
    degraded performance mode with only half the CPU cores available. Since we
    need to source some new hardware to permanently fix this, it will likely
    take a few weeks before we are back to full capacity.
